    "    The community's growing interest in feature and end-to-end learning is however restrained by the limited\n",
    "    availability of large audio datasets. The FMA aims to overcome this hurdle by providing 917 GiB and 343 \n",

    "    features, together with track- and user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text such as biographies. \n",
    "    We here describe the dataset and how it was created, propose a train/validation/test split and three subsets, \n",
